        <h2>Capstone Project</h2>   
        <p class="ptag">My capstone project is a MERN application that takes 2 sorting algorithms, compares the speed of them and outputs the results to the user. The project was a group effort of 
            Blake Thomas, Trace Erickson, Hunter Ferrin, and Jaren Montano.
        </p>
        <p class="ptag">The Algogauge group set out to create a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application that would enable users to input two different algorithms and compare their execution speeds. While we successfully implemented most aspects of the application, the C++ backend necessary for testing the algorithms' speeds was not completed.
        </p>
